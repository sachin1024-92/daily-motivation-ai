# Publishing FloatNote on Google Play

Everything that can be automated is done: the signed App Bundle, store text, icon,
feature graphic, privacy policy, a banner ad, in-app supporter tips, and an upload step in CI.
The steps below need **you**, signed in to Google as the account owner, because Google
requires the owner to verify their identity and accept its agreements.

Use the Google account you want to publish under.

## 1. Create the developer account (one time, ~$25)

1. Go to <https://play.google.com/console/signup> while signed in with that account.
2. Choose **Personal** (or **Organization** if you have a registered business / D-U-N-S number).
3. Pay the one-time $25 fee and complete **identity verification** (government ID).
   Verification can take a few days.
4. Set up a **payments profile** (Play Console → Settings → Payments profile) so you can
   receive supporter tip revenue. Add your bank account there.

> New *personal* accounts must run a **closed test with at least 12 testers for 14 days**
> before they can publish to Production. Organization accounts skip this.

## 2. Turn on release signing in GitHub (5 minutes)

Claude generated an upload key for you. Add the four values from `github-secrets.txt`
as repository secrets at
<https://github.com/sachin1024-92/daily-motivation-ai/settings/secrets/actions>:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `FLOATNOTE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | contents of `FLOATNOTE_KEYSTORE_BASE64.txt` |
| `FLOATNOTE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | from `github-secrets.txt` |
| `FLOATNOTE_KEY_ALIAS` | `floatnote` |
| `FLOATNOTE_KEY_PASSWORD` | from `github-secrets.txt` |

Then re-run the **FloatNote Android** workflow. Its `FloatNote.aab` is now Play-ready.
Store `floatnote-upload.jks` and the password in a password manager.

## 3. Create the app in Play Console

1. **Create app** → name `FloatNote: Floating Notepad`, default language English,
   **App**, **Free**. Accept the declarations.
2. **Store listing** (Grow → Store presence → Main store listing). Copy from
   `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`:
   - Short description: `short_description.txt`
   - Full description: `full_description.txt`
   - App icon: `images/icon.png` (512×512)
   - Feature graphic: `images/featureGraphic.png` (1024×500)
   - Phone screenshots: take 2–8 on your phone (the notes list, the bubble over another
     app, the open notepad, the Support screen with colours).
3. **App content** (Policy → App content):
   - **Privacy policy URL**: publish `PRIVACY.md` (e.g. enable GitHub Pages, or use the
     file's GitHub URL) and paste the link.
   - **Ads**: **Yes, contains ads** (one banner on the notes list).
   - **App access**: All functionality is available without special access.
   - **Content rating**: complete the questionnaire (Utility/Productivity, no
     objectionable content) → Everyone.
   - **Target audience**: 13+ (avoid "children" to keep the Families policy out of scope).
   - **Data safety**: the app contains the Google Mobile Ads SDK. Declare what Google lists
     for that SDK (<https://developers.google.com/admob/android/privacy/play-data-disclosure>):
     approximate location, app interactions, diagnostics and device or other IDs, collected
     and shared for advertising and analytics. Notes are **not** collected. Payments are
     processed by Google Play; FloatNote never receives payment details.
   - **Foreground service permissions**: declare **Special use**, describe it as
     "Keeps the user-enabled floating notepad bubble visible over other apps", and
     attach a short screen recording of turning the bubble on and using it.
   - **Government apps / Financial features / Health**: No.

## 4. Upload the first release

1. Download `FloatNote.aab` from the latest workflow run (signed with your key from step 2).
2. Testing → **Closed testing** → create a track → **Create new release**.
3. Accept **Play App Signing** (Google holds the app signing key; yours is the upload key).
4. Upload the `.aab`, add release notes from `whatsnew/whatsnew-en-US`, and roll out.
5. Add 12+ testers (a Google Group or email list) and keep the test running for 14 days.
   Then apply for **Production** access from the Dashboard.

## 5. Turn on real ads (revenue)

The app is built with Google's **test** ad IDs, so it shows test ads and earns nothing
until you add your own. Never tap real ads in your own app: AdMob bans accounts for it.

1. Sign up at <https://admob.google.com> with the same Google account and accept its terms.
   Add your payment details there (payouts start once you pass the USD 100 threshold).
2. **Apps → Add app** → Android. Until the app is live on Play, choose "not listed yet".
   Copy the **App ID** (looks like `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890`).
3. **Ad units → Add ad unit → Banner**. Copy the **Ad unit ID** (`ca-app-pub-…/…`).
4. Add both as GitHub repository secrets named `ADMOB_APP_ID` and `ADMOB_BANNER_ID`, then
   re-run the **FloatNote Android** workflow. Builds from then on carry your real IDs.
5. In AdMob → **Privacy & messaging**, create the **European regulations** consent message.
   The app already asks for consent before loading ads; it needs this message to show.
6. After the app is live, link it to its Play listing in AdMob so ads serve fully.

Be realistic: one banner earns a fraction of a rupee per view. Income only becomes
meaningful with thousands of daily users, so the supporter tips below matter more early on.

## 6. Create the supporter tips (revenue)

Monetize → Products → **In-app products** → create three **one-time** products with
exactly these IDs (the app looks them up by ID):

| Product ID | Suggested name | Suggested price |
|---|---|---|
| `supporter_coffee` | Buy me a coffee ☕ | $1.99 / ₹89 |
| `supporter_lunch` | Buy me lunch 🍱 | $4.99 / ₹249 |
| `supporter_hero` | FloatNote hero 🦸 | $9.99 / ₹499 |

Activate each. Any tip removes the ad and unlocks the extra bubble colours, and it restores automatically on
a reinstall or new phone. Google keeps 15% (on your first $1M/year).

To test purchases without being charged: Settings → **License testing** → add your
tester emails, then buy from a build installed via the testing track.

## 7. Later releases: fully automatic

1. In Google Cloud, create a service account, enable the **Google Play Android Developer
   API**, and create a JSON key.
2. In Play Console → Users and permissions → invite the service account email with
   *Release apps to testing tracks* permission.
3. Save the JSON as the GitHub secret `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
4. Bump `versionCode` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, then
   `git tag floatnote-v1.1.0 && git push origin floatnote-v1.1.0`.
   CI builds, creates a GitHub Release, and uploads the bundle to the internal track as
   a draft for you to promote.
